# BMC PMBus(I2C) voltage control

## Overvolting
brick.c does overvolting of the CPU. 
It will disable the OCP and OVP of the VMR and try to set the voltage to 3.0V. 

## Undervolting
undervolt.c will slowly decrease the voltage to inject fault to SGX. 

## Compiling and running
Both code need to be compiled with gnu gcc arm-linux-gnueabi toolchain.
You can install the toolchain with 

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
sudo apt install binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi
```

If the toolchain is not installed in the default path, change the `export PATH:=../arm-linux-gnueabi/bin` in the Makefile to the path of your toolchain.

The *.base can be uploaded to the BMC with `base64 -d < *.base > *.bin` once the SSH of the BMC is enabled via reflashing. See `x11-FirmwareRepacking` for details.
